== Installation ==

These installation instructions assume you have an active account established on Woopra.com.  If not, please visit the site and sign up for service.

Using the manual method:

1. Extract the Woopra.zip file to a location on your local machine
2. Upload the `woopra` folder and all contents into the `/plugins/` directory

Using the automatic method:

1. Click on 'Download' or 'Upgrade'
2. Wait for WordPress to acknowledge that it is on your system and ready to activate.

After step 2 (of either method):

3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Configure your API key and event settings in the Woopra Settings menu
(Your API key can be found in the Members area on Woopra.com)

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for the WordPress Plugin to work, your WordPress theme must have the following code immediately before the </BODY> element in the footer.php file:

    `<?php wp_footer(); ?>`

Without this function, the Woopra application will fail to track users who visit your site.
